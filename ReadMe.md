## 🎉 Intro

**`✅ Programmer Algorithm Challenges - Part II ✅`** 

Hey, there! I'm **`SEUNGMIN LEE`** and I gotta say,I've discovered that I need to dive deeper into algorithm problems while sharing my journey with everyone.

The questions are from [**`PROGRAMMERS`**](https://programmers.co.kr) and these are the lists of my solution ! 

This collection? It's where logic intertwines with innovation, powered by passion 🔥 and those late-night coding sprees 🌙

It didn't take ages to put together, but it's filled with excitement, obstacles, and enlightening moments.

Consider it my algorithmic journal in code. Each challenge captures stories of "What if I try this?" and "Wow, it actually worked!" instances 💡

So sit back, explore, and join me on my adventure in **`algorithmic problem-solving`** 😎
